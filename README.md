# What is this?

This contains implementations of a few algorithms in python. A lot of these already exist in the python world, so it
makes little sense to actually use them. This is instead intended as an educational exercise.

# Tests

Tests are located in the tests/unit directory, and can be executed using the following command:

```
py.test *
```
